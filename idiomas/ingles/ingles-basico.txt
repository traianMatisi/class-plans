1.9 - Common Nouns

	A noun is a word used to identify any of a class of people, places, or things (common noun),
	or to name a particular one of these (proper noun).

		-You can buy _coffee_ at _Starbucks_.
		

	A common noun is a noun denoting a class of objects or a concept as opposed to a particular individual.

		-There was a _sofa_, two _chairs_, and a _wardrobe_ in the _room_.
		
		
	Note that common nouns are ​general names. Thus, they are not capitalized unless they begin a sentence or are part of a title.

		-_Capitals_ of the countries are usually very large cities. London is the _capital_ of Great Britain.
		
		
	Most of the time, we add ​-s to singular nouns to indicate plurality.

		flower - flowers
		dog - dogs

	If the singular noun ends in ​-s, -ss, -sh, -ch, -x, -z, -o, add ​-es to make it plural.

		bus - buses
		watch - watches
		box - boxes
		potato - potatoes

	If the singular noun ends in ​-y, change ​-y into ​-i and add ​-es to make it plural.

		baby - babies

	If the singular noun ends in ​-f or ​-fe, ​-f is often changed into ​-ve before adding ​-s to make it plural.

		life - lives
		wolf - wolves
		belief - beliefs
		chef - chefs
		
	Some nouns do not follow any of the rules explained earlier. They are irregular. Here are the most common irregular nouns.

		man - men
		woman - women
		person - people
		child - children
		tooth - teeth
		foot - feet
		mouse - mice
